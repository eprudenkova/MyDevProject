Jenkins:
what are servers:
1. Stay power on all the time
2. Strong internet connection (in GBps) all the time
3. A lot of resources like RAM Disk etc

1) Developers will develop the code
2) Runs the unit tests if everything goes well ask the DevOps person to build that code and deploy the code on Dev servers
3) Developer verifies that code on Dev server
4) Request to DevOps person to deploy it on the integration server
5) Tester will ask DevOps person to deploy the code to QA server
6) Tester may deploy it on the Load server (is load server something where we perform performance testing),
Security testing servers
7) DevOps person deploy application on Staging servers (replica of production server) UAT server
(user acceptance testing (UAT) is where the demo happens) on which UAT is performed.
8) To production server

Issues in the manual Testing/deployment
1) Time consuming
2) if Multiple developers are working there can be issues in build
and to ix those issues we may need to look all of the newly added code
3) No Automation means a lot of manual effort

What is Jenkins?
open source automation server, which will help us to automate the application deployment in our infrastructure.
